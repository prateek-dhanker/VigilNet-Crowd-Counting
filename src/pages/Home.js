      headline: "Tamil Nadu Rally Stampede — 40 Dead",
      details:
        "The Tamil Nadu rally tragedy in Karur on September 27, 2025, was one of India's worst political gathering disasters. Over 40 people died, including children and women, and more than 124 were injured when tens of thousands surged forward during actor-politician Vijay's delayed appearance. Chaotic conditions and collapsed barricades led to multiple crowd crushes. Rescue was hindered by blocked ambulances and jammed exits. The state launched a formal inquiry and announced compensation. The incident exposed major lapses in planning and spotlighted urgent reforms needed for mass event safety in India."

      headline: "RCB Stadium Chaos — 11 Dead",
      details:
        "On June 3, 2025, celebrations at Bengaluru's M. Chinnaswamy Stadium turned deadly after a victory parade drew thousands of RCB fans. Security failed to control crowd surges at entry gates, resulting in 11 confirmed deaths and more than 50 injuries, many from asphyxiation and being trampled. Confusion over ticket checks and inadequate exit routes escalated risks. The Karnataka government ordered an inquiry and offered compensation. Experts now emphasize better stadium design, staff training, and real-time crowd monitoring to prevent future sports-related disasters."

        "At the Mahakumbh Mela in Prayagraj, January 2025, a crowd surge on a bathing day turned tragic, leaving more than 30 people dead according to official and media reports. Millions gathered on narrow passageways with insufficient barriers, causing stampedes at riverbanks. Most victims were suffocated or trampled in the rush. Police and local officials faced criticism for inadequate crowd management. Security has since been heightened and stricter protocols adopted for remaining festival days to protect worshippers."

Official tolls confirmed 18 deaths, with most victims being women and children, and dozens more injured. Passengers fell from footbridges and onto the tracks amid mass confusion. Rescue efforts restored order swiftly, but the event led to public outcry for improved crowd control and better early-warning procedures at major transport hubs. Railway authorities have committed to upgrading station safety protocols."
